# CBBrowser

**CBBrowser** is a one-page website which connects to a visible Couchbase database using user name and password.

We support calls to _all_docs to list all the documents and to a given document to see its contents.

We also show the Curl commands for getting a document, deleting it, attaching a file or putting a new version.

The code is all generic, so this is a public repo as a gift to the world!
